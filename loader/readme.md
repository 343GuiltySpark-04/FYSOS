To make the loader.sys file using SmallerC, use the following command line:

    smlrcc @make.txt

This assumes you have installed SmallerC which also uses your favorite assembler, default to NASM or FASM.

Find SmallerC and directions at:

To see the boot and loader in action, boot one of the two images in https://github.com/fysnet/FYSOS/tree/master/images within your favorite emulator, or copy to a floppy disk, hard drive, or USB thumb drive and boot on a physical machine.
