
This is the readme file for [m|w]putimg.exe

The mputimg.* files are for DOS and Windows, though older versions of Windows.
It has source to be compiled directly for True DOS, Win95, and WinXP.
However, it may or may not work with later versions of Windows.

The wputimg.* files are for WinXP only.  It is compiled for and used
specifically for WinXP.

It is unknown if they will compile and work on a 64-bit machine or
a Windows version after WinXP.

There are other utilities to write images to floppies, however, if you
still have a floppy drive, I am sure you still have an older version 
of DOS, Windows, or at the lastest WinXP.
