#### This is the source code to the [Font Editor](http://www.fysnet.net/fontedit/index.htm).

It is for Windows only, but can be compiled for 32-bit or 64-bit versions.

#### A note:
If you load the resource.rc file into the Visual Studio IDE, the IDE will alter
the file and break the build.  If you must edit the resource.rc file, make sure and use
a text editor, not the Visual Studio IDE editor.
