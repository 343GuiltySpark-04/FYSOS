This file is a list of example input items for mgptpart.exe along
with a description of how to create your own.

Instructions:
 1. A line may contain a '#' character as the character to indicate
    that any remaining characters in this line are used as a comment.
 2. A line must start with one of the following items:
    out:
    mbr:
    part:
    <blank space>
    # <comment goes here
 3. All spaces and tabs are ignored, including any spaces within
    filenames.  Therefore, you may not use a filename that includes
    a space character.
 4. The base= parameter *must* be a physical lba offset from the
    start of the disk.
 5. You may have up to 128 partitions specified.
 6. This utility does not check for out-of-bounds or overlapped
    partitions.
 7. All numbers are in hexidecimal or decimal.

Very few errors are checked.  It is up to the user to make sure
that all parameters are correct, images fit within the size given,
etc.  I did not make this utility to show how to find errors.  I
made this utility to show how to make GPT partitions.


Explanation of parameters:
 1. out:
    This is an optional parameter.  You do not have to include
    the out: parameter in your source.  If you do not, the target
    image file created is retrieved from the command line or defaults
    to "outfile.img".  However, if you do use this parameter, you must
    use the file= sub-parameter.

      file="filename.bin"
        This is a path and filename to the image file that will be created.
      spt=63
        This is the number of sectors per track used for this image/disk.
        This parameter is optional and defaults to 63 if not used.
      heads=16
        This is the number of heads (sides) used for this image/disk.
        This parameter is optional and defaults to 16 if not used.

 2. mbr:
    This is an optional parameter.  This parameter is used to indicate
    what 512 byte image to write to the 1st sector of the image.  The
    first partition entry with in this image will be over written and
    will point to LBA 1.  The other three will be zeroed.  If you use
    this parameter, you must use the file= sub-parameter.

      file="filename.bin"
        This is a path and filename to the image file that will be written
        to the first sector of the disk.

 3. part:
    This is a required parameter.  At least one is required, though no checks
    are made.  This is the parameter that indicates what type and size of partition
    to create.

      file="filename.bin"
        This is a path and filename to the image file that will be written
        to the partition at this base.  No check is made to see if the image
        file is larger that the partition size given.  The utility will pad
        the ending sectors with zeros if the image file is smaller than the
        size given.  This parameter is optional and may be omitted or used as:
          file=""
        If no filename is given, or this parameter is omitted, this utility
        will write zeros to the sectors within this partition.

      base=
        This parameter is required.  It is the base lba from the start of the
        disk.  Remember that all values are in decimal format and can not be 
        larger than 32 bits.

      size=
        This parameter is required.  It is the number of sectors in this partition.
        This number must be decimal and no more than 32 bits in size.

      type="system"
      type="hidden"
      type="legacy"
        This parameter not is required, however you may have more than one on
        a line.
         system - This is a required partition for the system
         hidden - This partition is hidden from the EFI system
         legacy - This partition can be booted from a legacy MBR system
         
      sys_id=
        This parameter not is required.  It is the type of partition format used.
        For example, if it is a FAT16 partition, you give a value of 4, so
        that the MBR's sys_id field is set accordingly.  The EFI does not care
        what value this is.  This is the value used if the sys_id is *not* 0xEE
        when a Protected MBR is used.

      boot_id=
        This parameter not is required.  It is the boot id of partition entry.
        Two values are used: 0x80 for the bootable partition and 0x00 for the
        remaining entries.

 4. type:
    This is the type of MBR to use.
      legacy
        Use the Legacy type of MBR.  The 'sys_id=' and 'boot_id=' parameters
        in #3 above will be required.
      efi
        Use the EFI's Protected MBR.  All of the partitions will be under one
        partition entry using the 0xEE system id.  The 'sys_id=' and 'boot_id=' 
        parameters in #3 above will be ignored.

** Please remember that no checks are made for accuracy.  It is up to the
   user to make sure that partitions are correctly spaced, sized, typed,
   and do not overlap.
