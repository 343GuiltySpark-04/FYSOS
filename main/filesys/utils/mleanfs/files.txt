# If you don't give the /E parameter on the command line, this app will
#  create an image that contains a MBR and the 16 sector boot code, specified
#  by the parameters below.
# If you do give the /E parameter, the mbrfile and bootfile parameters are
#  ignored, and the first sector written is the SuperBlock.
imgfile=  D:\fysos\main\filesys\images\leanfs.img

# When /E is used:
#   Base_lba is the LBA with in the existing image to write the Super Block to.
#   Everything from this LBA to LBA+tot_sects-1 will be modified
#   tot_sects does not include MBR or 16 sector boot
# When /E is not used:
#   Base_lba should be 63, but is not required.
#   tot_sects includes MBR, 16 sector boot, and all remaining blocks
# You may use decimal or hexadecimal numbers
base_lba= 0         # Base LBA of partition (LBA of 1st sector of boot code)
tot_sects= 10080    # Total number of blocks in partition
param0= 12          # (1<<12) blocks per band
heads= 16           # heads per cylinder
spt= 63             # sectors per track

# The remaining list of files are the files that this app should find and
#  write to the root directory of the image.  First parameter is the
#  full path name of the file to copy, second parameter is the name of the
#  file to use in the image's root directory.
# The third parameter is a dummy parameter, not used, but needed for the parser.
# You may have as many or as few as you wish.  Please note that this app
#  does not check for out of bounds due to too many root directory entries
#  specified below.
